I believe that success at Turing is going to be affected great by my willingness to share my thoughts, challenges, and solutions.
I also think that being good at collaboration will help a ton.
Engaging with alumni makes me a little nervous, but I guess they were in my shoes at one point!

I am going to get really good at scheduling and using my calendar! It's something I've always wanted to do and do well, so this is a great opportunity to try it.
Reviewing my notes and previous classes are things that I haven't done much before, but I've already started to get better at it.

I want to give a shout-out to my GF Audri as she has helped me prepare and make the move into a new career! The support has been great!

These are my new thoughts. This can be stessful when you don't allot enough time to practice.
